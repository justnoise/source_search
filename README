This is a small utility that is useful for indexing and searching
medium size source code repositories (currently using it to search >
10K files).  It was thrown together fairly quickly after reading
"Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index or How Google Code
Search Worked" by Russ Cox (no relation).  I figured I could do a much
shoddier job than he did (but in less time).  I'm fairly confident
that first goal was met/exceeded.

The entire thing is setup to fit my development environment so you'll
first need (1) change some of the parameters at the top of the file.
Second you need to fix up the finding/indexing of source files...  I'm
planning on getting all that sorted out RSN.

To use it, first index your sandbox with: python source_search.py -s
alternatively, if you're not working on my machine, index a single
directory tree with python source_search.py -i <directory>

Indexes consume a fair amount of space but that's the price you pay...

To search your sandbox simply enter the search terms: 
python source_search.py 'search string'
 
multiple word searches should be enclosed in quotes otherwise multiple
spaces between words are interpreted as a single space.  Yeah, I'm a
bit lazy
 
Wildcards (*) are accepted and used in their traditional globbing
sense however true regular expressions aren't implemented 
e.x.
python source_search.py numto*interval 
will return matches of numtodsinterval and numtoyminterval
