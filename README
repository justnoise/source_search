This is a small utility that is useful for indexing and searching
medium size source code repositories (currently using it to search >
10K files).  It was thrown together after reading "Regular Expression
Matching with a Trigram Index or How Google Code Search Worked" by
Russ Cox (no relation).  I figured I could do a much shoddier job than
he did but in less time.  I'm fairly confident that first goal was
met.

To use it, first update your index_files_path in options.py.  Next,
first index your sandbox with:

python source_search.py -i /path/to/sourcetree_1 /path/to/sourcetree_n

To search your sandbox simply enter the search terms: 
python source_search.py 'search string'
 
Multiple word searches should be enclosed in quotes otherwise multiple
spaces between words are interpreted as a single space.
 
Wildcards (*) are accepted and used in their traditional globbing
sense however true regular expressions aren't implemented 

Wildcard example:
python source_search.py numto*interval 
will return matches of numtodsinterval and numtoyminterval
